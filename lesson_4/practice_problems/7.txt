The block's return value is always true or false based on the last line, num.odd?. The return 
value of #any? here is true because any returns a boolean based on whether any of its block 
iterations return true. In this case, the first iteration is true. 1 is printed to the console 
during this evaluation, but no other numbers are printed because the first iteration of the 
block has already returned true, so #any doesn't evaluate any more iterations.
